# bingchat4urapp
An application that allows you to use BingChat in your Windows or Linux applications using the API of a local server. This application does not rely on reverse engineering APIs. Instead, it utilizes the Java Chromium Embedded Framework (JCEF) to emulate a browser environment and Selenium for browser control. This approach ensures a seamless and robust interaction with BingChat, providing a reliable tool for your application needs.

## How to use

Here are the request types and their expected responses (а full example of the program can be found in the “example” folder):

### POST /auth

This endpoint is used to create an authentication task. It expects a request body with `login` and `password` fields.

Example using Python:

```python
import requests

url = "http://localhost:8080/auth"
data = {"login": "your_login", "password": "your_password"}
response = requests.post(url, data=data)

print(response.text)
```
The server will return the ID of the created task.

### POST /createchat
This endpoint is used to create a chat. It expects a request body with a type field, which should be a number.
* 1 - More creative
* 2 - More Balanced
* 3 - More Precise

```python
import requests

url = "http://localhost:8080/createchat"
data = {"type": "2"}
response = requests.post(url, data=data)

print(response.text)
```
The server will return the ID of the created task.

### POST /sendpromt
This endpoint is used to create a prompt task. It expects a request body with promt and timeOutForAnswer fields. The timeOutForAnswer field should be a number.

data = {"promt": "your_prompt", "timeOutForAnswer": "90"}
response = requests.post(url, data=data)

print(response.text)
```
The server will return the ID of the created task.

### GET /get
