# bingchat4urapp
An application that allows you to use BingChat in your Windows or Linux applications using the API of a local server. This application does not rely on reverse engineering APIs. Instead, it utilizes the Java Chromium Embedded Framework (JCEF) to emulate a browser environment and Selenium for browser control. This approach ensures a seamless and robust interaction with BingChat, providing a reliable tool for your application needs.

2. Download the .jar file from the Releases section.
3. Run .jar file using following command: `java --add-exports java.base/java.lang=ALL-UNNAMED --add-exports java.desktop/sun.awt=ALL-UNNAMED --add-exports java.desktop/sun.java2d=ALL-UNNAMED -jar bingchat4urapp_server-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar` 
4. The application will be launched on port 8080.

## Proxy Support
If you want to use a proxy, you need to pass the proxy address as a parameter to the .jar file. Please note that only SOCKS5 proxies are supported. For example, you can pass the proxy to the application through the console like this:

```bash
java --add-exports java.base/java.lang=ALL-UNNAMED --add-exports java.desktop/sun.awt=ALL-UNNAMED --add-exports java.desktop/sun.java2d=ALL-UNNAMED -jar bingchat4urapp_server-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar --proxy 127.0.0.1:8521
```

## How to use

Here are the request types and their expected responses (а full example of the program can be found in the “example” folder):

### POST /api/auth

This endpoint is used to create an authentication task. It expects a request body with `login` and `password` fields.

Example using Python:

```python
url = "http://127.0.0.1:8080/api/auth"
data = {"login": login, "password": password}
response = requests.post(url, json=data)
    
print("Response from server =", response.text)
```
The server will return the ID of the created task.

### POST /api/createchat
This endpoint is used to create a chat. It expects a JSON body with a `type` field, which should be a number:
* `1` - More creative
* `2` - More Balanced
* `3` - More Precise

Example using Python:
```python
import requests

url = "http://127.0.0.1:8080/api/createchat"
data = {"type": 3}
response = requests.post(url, json=data)

print(response.text)
```
The server will return the ID of the created task.

### POST /api/sendpromt
This endpoint is used to create a prompt task. It expects a JSON body with `promt` and `timeOutForAnswer` fields. The `timeOutForAnswer` field should be a number representing the timeout for the answer in seconds.

Example using Python:
```python
import requests

url = "http://127.0.0.1:8080/api/sendpromt"
data = {"promt": "your_prompt", "timeOutForAnswer": 90}
response = requests.post(url, json=data)

print(response.text)
```
The server will return the ID of the created task.

### GET /api/get/{id}
This endpoint is used to retrieve a task by its ID. It expects the `id` to be passed as a part of the URL.

Example using Python:
```python
import requests

url = "http://localhost:8080/get/1"
response = requests.get(url)

print(response.text)
```
The server will return a TaskModel object with the following fields:

* id: The ID of the task.
* type: The type of the task (1 for auth Bing, 2 for send prompt to Bing).
* data: The data of the task.
* isFinished: A boolean indicating whether the task is finished.
* gotError: A boolean indicating whether there was an error.
* result: The result of the task (answer on your ptomt)

### GET /api/exit
This endpoint is used to close server app correctly.

Example using Python:
```python
import requests

response = requests.get("http://127.0.0.1:8080/api/exit")
print("Session ended.")
```
